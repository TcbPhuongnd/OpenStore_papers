################################ POSE3D
# 1. Cross-View Tracking for Multi-Human 3D Pose Estimation at over 100 FPS
# - solve the issue of camera asynchronization (not simultaneously) to update pose3D
# - example of considering time for AFFINITY MATRIX
# - github: https://github.com/longcw/crossview_3d_pose_tracking (no sourcecode)
# 2. Fast and Robust Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation from Multiple Views
# - example of combining re-identification features & pose3d reconstruction for tracking, 
# - solve matching by Hungarian algorithm
# - github: https://github.com/zju3dv/mvpose
# =>>>> The affinity measurement = feature + poseDiff(g, t)
# 3. Real-Time Multi-View 3D Human Pose Estimation using Semantic Feedback to Smart Edge Sensors
# - update the pose based on the weight and also track the pose
# - github: https://github.com/AIS-Bonn/SmartEdgeSensor3DHumanPose
